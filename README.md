# SCAFFOLDER

This project kickstarts a project and sets:
  - jest
  - dotenv
  - babel
  - bunyan
  - standard
  - prettier
  - vscode conf
  - editorconfig
  - nodemon
  - precommit hooks

## USAGE

just `cd` to your repository (created based on this one) and:

- `yarn build` - to create a optimized babel-free version
- `yarn dev` - to start your production optimized version
- `yarn dev` - to start working
- `yarn test` - to run tests
- `yarn test src/path/to/your/file.test.js` to sun specific test
- `git commit` - run this without message after adding files to stage to run ESLint on staged files

## REQUIREMENTS

- Node (Any version above 6 should work, tested on version 8+)
- Yarn (Again, any version, tested with 1+)
- Git

### Using startup shell script
Just type this in your terminal:
